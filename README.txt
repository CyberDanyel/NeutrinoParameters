Equations contains important equations
Parabola_Minimiser is the file that contains all the minimizers
Both modules above are needed for the rest of the code to run
Project1 is a file i used to test the code, nothing in my report is produced from it
All other files produce the graphs and results in my report
For any minimizers that return errors, they return two tuples. The first tuple is the minimized values.
The second tuple is the errors, where the first value represents the error in the negative direction and the second value
represents the error in the positive direction
